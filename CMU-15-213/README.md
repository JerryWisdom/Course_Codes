### Notes on links

- **pptx** links are to Powerpoint versions of the lectures
- **pdf** links are to Adobe Acrobat versions of the lectures

- **video** links are to videotapes of the lectures
- **tar** links are to archive files in TAR format. Use the tar command on a linux machine to unpack these


## Notice

**All the copy in Github from 15-213's website (like ppt, pdf and so on) will be removed according to the *Cheating/Plagiarism: Description* in the first lecture after I finish my learning.**

Here are the texts from their slides：

- Unauthorized use of information

  - Borrowing code: by copying, retyping, looking at a file
  - Describing: verbal description of code from one person to another.
  - Searching the Web for solutions
  - Copying code from a previous course or online solution
  - Reusing your code from a previous semester (here or elsewhere)
    - If specific to 213/513, and you received credit
- Unauthorized supplying of information

  - Providing copy: Giving a copy of a file to someone
  - Providing access:
    - Putting material in unprotected directory
    - Putting material in unprotected code repository (e.g., Github)
  - Applies to this term and the future
    - There is no statute of limitations for academic integrity violations

- What is NOT cheating?

  - Explaining how to use systems or tools
  - Helping others with high-level design issues
  - Using code supplied by us
  - Using code from the CS:APP web site

 - See the course syllabus for details.
   - Ignorance is not an excuse
